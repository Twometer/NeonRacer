# How to set up

1. Clone the repository

2. Run `gradlew` to build the gradle project

3. Import gradle project into IntelliJ (using File -> Open)

4. Create a run configuration that executes the tasks `build execute`

Be sure to check the `Create directories for empty content roots automatically` box because it is annoying to create the directories yourself.

**NOTE: Please submit code changes using pull requests, and do not commit directly into the master branch.**
