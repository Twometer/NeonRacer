# How to set up

1. Clone the repository

2. Run `gradlew` to build the gradle project. (Make sure it runs to completion. If the cmd window closes after a very short time, you probably don't have java installed.)

3. Load gradle project into IntelliJ (**using File -> Open**)

Be sure to check the `Create directories for empty content roots automatically` box because it is annoying to create the directories yourself.

4. Create a run configuration that executes the tasks `build execute`


**NOTE: Please submit code changes using pull requests, and do not commit directly into the master branch.**
