# How to set up

1. Clone the repository

2. Load gradle project (the folder this file is in!) into IntelliJ (**using File -> Open**)

Be sure to check the `Create directories for empty content roots automatically` box because it is annoying to create the directories yourself.

3. After IntelliJ has loaded, expand the src folder on the left side and find "NeonRacerMain". Right click this and click on "Run NeonRacerMain.main()". This will create a run configuration for you and then start the application.

**NOTE: Please submit code changes using pull requests, and do not commit directly into the master branch.**
